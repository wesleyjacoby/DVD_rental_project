# Data Analysis using SQL on fictitious DVD Rental Data
Udacity project using SQL for the analysis of fictitious DVD Rental Data

# Project Overview
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of my project submission, I ran SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

### Program Details:
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as:

* Top 5 Customers
* Movie Genres vs Revenue
* Top 5 Customers Favourite Genre
* Average Amount Spent (Histogram)

# Project Data
Below is the schema for the database:
